# Barangay Management System - Integration & Fix Report

## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Login/Logout Issue Resolution ✅
**Problem**: Users could login but couldn't logout properly from disaster portal
**Root Cause**: Missing error handling and incomplete session cleanup in logout function
**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced logout function with try-catch error handling
- Added comprehensive session cleanup (localStorage, sessionStorage)
- Implemented force navigation fallback
- Fixed routing inconsistencies in disaster portal access

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Enhanced logout with proper error handling
const handleLogout = () => {
  try {
    logout();
    navigate('/');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Logout error:', error);
    // Force navigation even if logout fails
    navigate('/');
  }
};

// Improved AuthContext logout method
const logout = () => {
  try {
    setUser(null);
    localStorage.removeItem('user');
    localStorage.removeItem('authToken');
    sessionStorage.clear();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Logout error:', error);
    setUser(null); // Force clear even if there's an error
  }
};
```
