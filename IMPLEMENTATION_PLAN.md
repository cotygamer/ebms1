- **Error Recovery**: <5% of users require manual intervention for sync issues
- **Adoption**: >80% of field workers use offline features regularly

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Storage Limitations**: Implement storage monitoring and cleanup
- **Sync Conflicts**: Comprehensive conflict resolution strategies
- **Performance Degradation**: Optimize sync algorithms and batch processing

### User Experience Risks
- **Confusion About Offline Status**: Clear, persistent status indicators
- **Data Loss Concerns**: Transparent sync status and confirmation messages
- **Complex Conflict Resolution**: Simplified conflict resolution UI

## Deployment Strategy

### Rollout Plan
1. **Internal Testing**: Deploy to test environment with simulated offline scenarios
2. **Pilot Group**: Deploy to small group of field workers for real-world testing
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Expand to all users with monitoring and support
4. **Full Deployment**: Complete rollout with comprehensive monitoring

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flags to disable offline functionality if issues arise
- Database rollback procedures for sync-related data corruption
- Client-side rollback to previous version if critical bugs discovered
